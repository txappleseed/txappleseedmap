    "This script takes Texas Education Agency data about school district demographics and disciplinary actions, and puts them together in one GeoJSON file for the Texas Appleseed \"School to Prison Pipeline\" map. See http://www.texasdisciplinelab.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the script, follow these instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For every year that you want to cover, download all 20 of the region files from http://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/adhocrpt/Disciplinary_Data_Products/Download_Region_Districts.html and put them in the directory '../data/from_agency/by_region/'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For every year that you want to cover, download the \"District and Charter Detail Data\" Snapshot Data File (comma-delimited *.dat)\" from https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/snapshot/download.html. The website automatically delivers these files with the same filename: district.dat. You will need to rename them to have different names by adding the year after \"district\". For instance, \"district2016.dat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This script needs a GeoJSON file of district shapes. Make sure it can find that file at '../geojson/base_districts.geojson'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Change the first_year and last_year variables below to reflect the years you want your file to cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run the notebook with \"Kernel -> Restart and Run All\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Wait a while for it to finish. After about 15 minutes, the notebook should produce 'districts_with_data.geojson' in the '../geojson/' directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The resulting file will be about 20 MB depending on how many years it covers. You can make it smaller (about 10 MB) by uploading it to http://mapshaper.org/, using the \"simplify\" function to reduce the number of lines in the district boundaries, and exporting the file as TopoJSON instead of GeoJSON. I did this and put the result in the '../topojson/' directory."
